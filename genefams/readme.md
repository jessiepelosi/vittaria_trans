Load Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv output file from OrthoFinder (for Pteridacaeae + <i> Asplenium </i>) into Count v. 9.1106 (Csűrös 2010). Run Count under Wagner Parsimony with  gain penatly of 1.2 (<i> Amborella </i> Genome Project 2013, Li et al. 2018) to identify gene families (orthogroups) that have expanded/contracted or gained/lost in <i> V. appalachiana </i>. Export Wagner Parsimony analysis from Count and Orthogroups.txt from OrthoFinder and input these into "gene_familiy_evol.R".
